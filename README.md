---

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes responses from a **Data Professional Survey** to understand trends in job roles, salaries, programming languages, job satisfaction, and demographics within the data industry.  
The complete workflow includes **data cleaning with Power Query, exploratory analysis, and interactive dashboard development in Power BI**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Data modeling, DAX, interactive visualizations  
- **Power Query (M Language)**: Data cleaning and transformation  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Raw data storage and preprocessing  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: Data Professional Survey  
- **Format**: Excel (.xlsx)  
- **Responses**: Global survey participants  
- **Key Fields**: Role, Salary, Programming Language, Satisfaction Ratings, Demographics  

> Both raw and cleaned datasets are included in this repository.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Imported raw Excel data using Power Query  
- Removed irrelevant columns (Browser, OS, City, Referrer, etc.)  
- Cleaned job titles, industries, and country fields  
- Processed salary ranges and calculated **Average Salary**  
- Standardized satisfaction ratings and data types  

(Detailed steps available in `power_query_steps.md`)

---

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed salary distribution across job roles  
- Compared programming language preferences  
- Examined job satisfaction factors such as:
  - Salary  
  - Work-life balance  
  - Learning opportunities  
  - Career growth  

---

### 3. Data Modeling for Power BI
- Created relationships between demographic and survey fields  
- Optimized data model for performance and filtering  
- Prepared analysis-ready tables from cleaned data  

---

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
- Built interactive visuals for:
  - Salary vs Role analysis  
  - Programming language popularity  
  - Job satisfaction metrics  
  - Demographic distribution  
- Added slicers for country, role, and experience  
- Designed a clean, professional layout for insights  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Data Scientists and Data Engineers earn higher average salaries  
- Python is the most preferred programming language across roles  
- Work-life balance and learning opportunities strongly impact satisfaction  
- Many professionals transitioned into data from non-technical backgrounds  

---

## 💡 Quantified Impact
- Analyzed survey responses from data professionals worldwide  
- Cleaned and standardized 100% of records using Power Query  
- Created **multiple interactive visuals** with dynamic filtering  
- Delivered a dashboard suitable for business and career insights
